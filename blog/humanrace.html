 <h2 id="be-the-yes-right-now-">Be The &quot;Yes, Right Now&quot;.</h2>
 <p>You have to look at it a little differently, but it&#39;s shockingly correct to call it a &quot;race&quot;. Some might say we are collectively, the &quot;human race&quot;, and in that metaphor I see individual humans as but runners in it. When we run, there are winners and losers. If the race is long enough, some don&#39;t even finish.  I know I&#39;m cop-ing a term that actually comes from the latin word, <em>raice</em>, or <em>root</em>. But today, the idiosyncratic coincidence that this term shares a meaning with a competitive athletic event rings true. Then there&#39;s this overarching narrative of Evolution which tells us that we are all evolved to this point, and it took millions of years, and it was a slow process, and the underlying, unseen law governing this process is &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, choosing the winners and losers.  So the unseen, unfeeling, unthinking forces of survival are what&#39;s driving us forward, then what are we really seeing when we observe how we treat each other so badly today?</p>
 <p>We must be on that gradual movement toward a new thing; a new being that surpasses humanity and one day outlast us all as the fittest, wiping us out or just waiting for us to do the dirty work ourselves.  If that&#39;s happening, we&#39;re just the &quot;Not quite yet&quot; of the world. We&#39;re the almost there, the in-process version of a new humanity, a new species.  That elusive survival of the fittest lurking around every corner could conceivably drive you to a state of terror and a blistering, dangerous reality if you see yourself as less than fit.  What might someone do to another person or group of persons when they see themselves as threatened out of existence? What might someone do to stay on top?</p>
 <p>This idea fundamentally undermines the societies which embrace it.  Our super-awareness of ourselves and our surroundings isn&#39;t making us better or more peaceful, but only more paranoid. We might not see it, but there&#39;s no progress without understanding that survival depends on all of us together, not just the fittest.  May we all wake up in the morning not with the dread of being &quot;Not quite yet&quot;, we choose to walk in the truth, that we are all &quot;Yes, Right Now&quot;. These images taken from the 2017 EJI Equal Justice Calendar sparked this brief essay.</p>

       <figcaption class="tiny">On August 9, 1938, Otis Price, a 22-year-old black man, was lynched in Perry, Florida, for walking past a white farmer's home while the farmer's wife was bathing in an open doorway.  A white mob seized him, slit his throat, riddled his body with bullets, and then left his corpse on the side of the road.  In summer 2016, volunteers with <a href="https://eji.org/community-remembrance-project" target="_blank">EJI's Community Remembrance Project</a> collected soil from the area where Mr. Price was killed. <span class="tiny">(Kirsten LeJoudis)</span></figcaption>

 <p><a href="https://eji.org" title="EJI homepage">The Equal Justice Initiative</a> is home to a <a href="https://calendar.eji.org">yearly calendar</a> &quot;EJI Calendar&quot;) depicting the history of despicable events surrounding discrimination and animosity toward people of color.  The history of injustice is not necessarily an indication of our future, but the reminder is powerful, when every day we can see just how many terrible things we&#39;ve done as humans, running in this race, trying to get ahead by any means necessary.  </p>
 <p>I would like to remind us that there is a different way, and Jesus offers us to walk that narrow path together. At the end there&#39;s no winner, since we&#39;re all guilty of trechary and sin; no loser, since all are created in the image of God; just us and a glorious celebration, and everyone is invited.  Your survival and your fitness doesn&#39;t even matter.</p>
